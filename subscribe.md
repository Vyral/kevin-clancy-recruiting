<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in the Capital Region?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year around 6,000 homes sold in the greater Capital Region market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell over 250 homes last year and our average agent earns $75,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</oL></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>
