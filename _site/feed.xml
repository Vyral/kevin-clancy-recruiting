        <title>Why Do We Tend to Fail With Our Resolutions &amp; How Can This Be Fixed?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9P1ZkDRs5xM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are you faring with your New Year’s resolutions? Here’s how you can be sure you’ll have success with your goals for 2019, in real estate or otherwise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a month into 2019, which means it’s time to take initial stock of our New Year’s resolutions that we set for ourselves. Are yours still intact? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a statistic recently that left me dumbfounded: &lt;strong&gt;92% of us will fail to live up to our resolutions by Valentine’s Day.&lt;/strong&gt; This obviously gave me pause—why do so many of us seem to fail in this way? We all have good intentions with our goals, whether they be in real estate, fitness, lifestyle, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it boils down to is that &lt;strong&gt;we sometimes fail to rise to the level of our goals, and we, unfortunately, fall to the level of our systems and processes to get us to those goals.&lt;/strong&gt; Not having a system and process in place to accomplish any goal you set will inevitably lead to failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the old cliché: Successful people do what failures do not. This is partly true, but more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;successful people &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt; do what failures occasionally do. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a real estate sense, our office has more leads than we can handle, and all it takes is carving out two hours a day to pick up the phone and go after those leads. Following that approach is an easy, surefire way to sell 25 to 30 homes and make $100,000 a year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another key piece for hitting your goals is to take on some sort of identity.&lt;/strong&gt; I recently spoke to an ultramarathoner and in conversation with him, I mentioned that I’m a runner as well. This is the first time in my life that I’ve assumed the identity of being a runner. Having that identity fuels me to get out of bed to do my morning runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Successful people consistently do what failures occasionally do.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/why-do-we-tend-to-fail-with-our-resolutions-how-can-this-be-fixed.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Successful people consistently do what failures occasionally do.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for you as a Realtor. &lt;strong&gt;You need to take on the identity that you’re a professional Realtor, money will flow into your life easily and often, and you’ll do what it takes to remain steadfast in that identity.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about goal attainment or the discipline and habits that go with it, please give me a call at 518-461-9937. I’d love to help in any way I can. Have an awesome 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Share Your Wisdom and Become a Mentor</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixOY1P2oXzA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mentoring doesn’t just help others. It helps you as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019’s here! I hope you had a great holiday season and are looking forward to making this year your best one yet. Though we’re hearing all sorts of news about how the real estate market will be heading downward, we can persevere; if you work hard and maintain the basics, you’re going to be successful in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today I want to focus on the one thing that could truly change your life this year: &lt;strong&gt;mentoring someone.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been blessed in becoming a mentor to a young man who needs guidance in his life. Helping him has actually helped me more than I ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re successful, it can be easy to forget about the rookies. &lt;strong&gt;Take someone in your office who’s struggling and help them.&lt;/strong&gt; Tell them how you handled your early years. You’ll not only instill wisdom upon those who need it, but you’ll also learn a lot about yourself and your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=By mentoring others, the life we save is often our own.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/share-your-wisdom-and-become-a-mentor.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“By mentoring others, the life we save is often our own.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In David Goggins’ book, “Can’t Hurt Me,” he talks about an instructor who trained two people on how to open a blocked airway. A few days later in a skydiving incident, the instructor’s airway became clogged and he was unable to breathe. &lt;strong&gt;He was then saved by the two people he had trained just two days prior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mentoring others, the life we save is often our own. So I challenge you to take someone under your wing; what you’re truly giving is much, much more than advice. &lt;strong&gt;And if you yourself are struggling, reach out to me, and I’ll pull you up.&lt;/strong&gt; I want you to be successful, and with the great business we have in Albany real estate, we can all afford to help one another grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact me if you have any questions, have information, or simply need some help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Set Goals That Will Take Your Career to the Next Level in 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWtNNYtsz2s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to take your career to the next level in 2019, start by setting goals that seem impossible to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you set your goals for 2019? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already made a business plan for 2019, &lt;strong&gt;now’s the time to get your goals down in writing.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a proven fact that if you write your goals down, you’ll have a better chance at achieving them. Even if you don’t achieve them, you will still accomplish more than what you would have if you didn’t write them down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When setting your goals, you want to have a BHAG, or a “big, hairy, audacious goal.”&lt;/strong&gt; For example, what’s the highest number of homes you think you can sell? 75? Double it and shoot for 150. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my start in real estate, I was selling homes out of my bedroom. I had no systems, processes, or CRMs to speak of. My leads were sticky notes stuck to my laptop. Things have changed a lot since then, but that’s because I had the will to succeed. When I was in that bedroom, I set a goal to sell 100 homes in one year. At the time, I thought that was impossible, but I ended up selling 105 homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You need to set a goal that’s so high that you might assume you can’t possibly do it.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/how-to-set-goals-that-will-take-your-career-to-the-next-level-in-2019.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You need to set a goal that’s so high that you might assume you can’t possibly do it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you set a crazy-high goal, you start thinking of the systems and processes you need to achieve that goal. This effect relates to an all-important principle about goals: &lt;strong&gt;It’s not achieving the goal that’s important—it’s about who you become while achieving that goal. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I completed my very first marathon not too long ago, and you know what? It didn’t matter to me whether I finished that marathon or not. Obviously, I wanted to finish it, but it’s who I became during the three months of training leading up to that marathon that was really important. I lost 30 pounds, my resting heart rate dropped, and I just became a better person overall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to real estate. You need to set a goal that’s so high that you might assume you can’t possibly do it. Just by setting it, you’ll still achieve more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at it this way: If I set a goal to do 10 pushups, I’ll do 10 pushups and then quit. If I set a goal to do 100, though, I might just do 14, 16, or even 20 pushups. You might think you failed in achieving your goal if you do only 20 pushups, but you also doubled what you would’ve done if your goal was only 10 pushups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you plan for 2019, remember to set your goals so high that you think there’s no way you’ll be able to achieve them. I promise that you’ll achieve amazing results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re having trouble setting goals or you’d like to talk about what it’s like being on a team where you can make $100,000 a year, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I would absolutely love to help you reach your goals and have an amazing life and career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any other questions for me or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If You’re Serious About Your Real Estate Career, I Have an Offer for You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Waz-iHEfb50?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you serious about your real estate career? If the answer is yes, I have an opportunity for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the holidays are here, I have an opportunity to share with you and I want to talk a little about what’s happening in our industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that, in terms of the number of Realtors in our industry, we’re peaking? Over the next 18 to 24 months, though, &lt;strong&gt;we’re going to lose a lot of them as the market starts to shift.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s just an unfortunate part of the cycle our industry goes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last month, I’ve had multiple people contact me looking for a job. The conversations I’ve had with them, though, usually involve them asking, “What can you offer me?” That’s the funny part about real estate—in what other industry would you call an employer and ask them what they can offer you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’re serious about your career, come talk to me.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/if-youre-serious-about-your-real-estate-career-i-have-an-offer-for-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re serious about your career, come talk to me.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I interviewed someone who I knew within 30 seconds wouldn’t be a good fit for my company, but sure enough, the next day they told me they were considering taking the position. I had to remind them, of course, that I hadn’t even offered them the position yet. We’re a bit more selective than that when it comes to who we hire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, here’s my gift I want to offer you: If you’re serious about your career, come talk to me. I guarantee that if you’re hired, you will make at least $25,000 a year. If you don’t, I’ll personally write you a check for that amount. &lt;strong&gt;If you stick to our team’s regimen and follow our lead generation systems, you’ll not only make more money, but you’ll work fewer hours and have less stress. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you need to be the right person for the job. There’s no barrier for entry into our business, and a lot of people get into thinking they’ll be driving a Mercedes 550 and making a few hundred grand a year without actually working. As we know, the reality is far different. &lt;strong&gt;Real estate is a great career, but it takes work.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in this opportunity, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you have an absolutely fantastic holiday with your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Our office is an unofficial drop-off site for Toys for Tots, so if you have any toys you’d like to donate this year, give them to us and we’ll make sure they find their way to this great organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boost Your Own Success by Surrounding Yourself With People You Can Learn From</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/98kZ-L3PEx4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whether in life or business, surrounding yourself with people who are more successful than you is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays can be a tough time for real estate, but don’t let that stop you from chasing success. There are a number of things you can do to stay successful no matter the state of the market, and one of the best ways is by &lt;strong&gt;surrounding yourself with greatness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised how big an impact the people in your life have on your success. In many ways, you are the average of the people you spend your time with. If you find the average income of your five closest friends, for example, chances are that figure will reflect your own current income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who are you hanging out with? If you’re always the smartest person in the room, then you’re doing something wrong. &lt;strong&gt;You should be surrounding yourself with people who are producing at a level you strive to someday reach—not at a level you’ve already surpassed. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same concept applies in life, too.  As you guys already know, I’m a runner. And as a runner, I often find that the people who motivate me most are the ones ahead of me in a race. It’s those kinds of people who push me to run faster. Even more interestingly, you never know when your own efforts will motivate someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’re always the smartest person in the room, then you’re doing something wrong.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/boost-your-own-success-by-surrounding-yourself-with-people-you-can-learn-from.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re always the smartest person in the room, then you’re doing something wrong.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my most recent race, for example. I was keeping up a few paces behind this guy in front of me for most of the race, using his endurance as a way to keep myself going, only to find out by speaking to him later that he was using me as motivation too. He said that when he heard me coming up behind him, it made him want to run even faster. The point is this: &lt;strong&gt;Being around greatness makes you better.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as the end of the year approaches, position yourself around people who you can learn and grow from. Find top producers and talk to them about what they’re doing to stay successful into 2019. Many of them will be happy to help you out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can Persistence Transform Your Career?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdCeBkF0vrk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the holidays just around the corner and our market slowing down, now is the time to remain persistent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably remember from some of my recent messages, I recently ran my first marathon. And I’ve got to tell you, it was a challenge. Around the sixth or seventh mile into the race, things started getting really tough. Even so, one concept kept me going: persistence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As real estate professionals, this is the same concept we need to apply right now.&lt;/strong&gt; The holidays are just around the corner, activity has been slowing down, and, around this time of year, a lot of mediocre agents out there start feeling a little shaken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at what might lie ahead for our market, it can be easy to feel intimidated. But just like I told myself after completing the first few miles of that marathon, now is the time to remain persistent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter how many times you get knocked down, you’ve got to keep getting up.&lt;/strong&gt; Now is not the time to start questioning what you’re doing. Think about your target and stick to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the importance of this, I’d like to share another quick story. I’ve got two friends who were both farming for leads. One kept talking about how successful his farm was and how well he was doing. The other agent, who had been farming his area for the same amount of time, was insistent that the first agent’s method just wouldn’t work in his market. In truth, this was just an excuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first agent was sending out 10,000 mailers and the other was sending out 500. On a percentage basis, their response rate was identical, but the agent who was sending out 10,000 mailers, obviously, was doing far better. &lt;strong&gt;The only difference between the two of them was their level of effort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It takes persistence to succeed.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/how-can-persistence-transform-your-career.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It takes persistence to succeed.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes massive action to achieve massive results. It takes persistence to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t be telling you this if I didn’t care. I understand that with the holidays coming up, it can be a difficult time of year for many. It isn’t always easy to remain persistent. So, in addition to offering the advice I’ve shared today, I’d also like to let you know that if you happen to be alone this Thanksgiving, my table has a place for you. &lt;strong&gt;I can’t promise the quality of my cooking will be particularly amazing, but I can promise it will be a great time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Zillow Is Actually Your Friend</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSQflgvxDgA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those who say that Zillow is ruining the real estate industry really don’t know what they’re talking about. Here’s why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go on listing appointments every day and talk to agents every day who are down on Zillow and think it’s ruining our industry. However, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with top executives from Zillow in D.C. as well as the CEO of Century 21 and former Zillow Executive Nick Bailey. &lt;strong&gt;I actually love Zillow and what it’s doing for the industry. Here’s why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who hate Zillow because of their inaccuracies when it comes to valuing homes point to the fact that their standard deviation is about 13% off from actual home value. &lt;strong&gt;However, you don’t want that Zestimate to be spot on as an agent.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s 100% right, your value-add as an agent gets diminished. What does a buyer or seller need from you if they can just get the actual value from Zillow in an instant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you hate about the Zestimate. &lt;strong&gt;You don’t have the script or the skills to overcome clients who want to list their home at what the Zestimate says&lt;/strong&gt;. When this Zestimate is off, it gives you the opportunity to showcase your skills at valuing a home and showing how you can add value to a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=An inaccurate Zestimate offers you the chance to prove yourself as an agent.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/why-zillow-is-actually-your-friend.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“An inaccurate Zestimate offers you the chance to prove yourself as an agent.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zillow is your friend and you want to embrace that Zestimate.&lt;/strong&gt; It gives you an opportunity to improve your scripts and improve your lead conversion so that you can show potential clients what you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about Zestimates, Zillow leads, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Create Value for Your Clients By Writing Your Own Emails</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/84-UchT-mSk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you take the time to write your own material in the emails you send out to clients, you’ll be able to build your following much faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you send out emails to clients, are you writing them yourself or are you sending canned emails that you bought? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten a lot of emails lately from other Realtors about various topics that were all canned emails, and I want to let you in on a little secret: &lt;strong&gt;People open emails for a reason.&lt;/strong&gt; There has to be something in it for them, and your tagline is super important in increasing your open rate &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I was named as the No. 1 Realtor in the Capital Region. How did I do it? Every Monday I would send out an email that I called the “Monday Morning Mojo,” which was a message of positive, observational thoughts I’d made over the previous week that didn’t really have anything to do with real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started sending these out, though, I was buying them canned. Two keys to success are self awareness and authenticity, and in my case, I wasn’t being authentic. When you’re not writing your own material, you’re not being authentic. Once I started writing my emails, I was able to generate a following that numbered in the thousands. People began to know me because of my emails. My open rate was about 80%, which is unheard of for an email blast. If you’d like to see an example, you can check out the monday morning mojo &lt;a href=&quot;https://mondaymorningmojowithkevin.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;instead of sending out canned emails that you bought, write something that actually provides knowledge and creates value for your clients.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, after I’m finished with this video, I plan on shooting another video explaining to my clients why it’s important for both buyers and sellers to move quickly due to rising interest rates. As you may know, a 1% rise in interest rates decreases buyers’ purchasing power by 10%. It’s very important for buyers and sellers to know this, and it’s important that they take action before rates move further into the mid-5% range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When you’re not writing your own material, you’re not being authentic.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/create-value-for-your-clients-by-writing-your-own-emails.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When you’re not writing your own material, you’re not being authentic.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t forget to personalize your email and make it hyper-local to your client’s area. If you do this, I guarantee that they’ll gravitate to you because you’re not sending them the same stuff that every other insurance broker, mortgage broker, or Realtor is sending them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions about this topic or you’d like to talk more about it with me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. And remember—my team is growing, so if you want to know what it’s like to make six figures and be on a team where all leads are provided, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do You Know What You Want Your Legacy to Be?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYY-Yi9FlX4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I’m training for an upcoming marathon, and I ran my third 20-mile run this morning. 20 miles is not easy—it’s tough, and it puts a strain on my old bones. It took me a little under three hours to finish, and one thing I noticed during this run was a tremendous number of historic markers in our area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking: What does it take to have a marker built in your name so that people are still thinking about you 150 or 200 years later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read some of these markers and learned about the people they were built for, I saw phrases like “gentleman farmer” and “gentleman soldier,” but nothing more significant than that. This made me think of an exercise I did a few years back with one of my old coaches: Writing your own obituary. &lt;strong&gt;What is your legacy and what do you want to be remembered for?&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing the answer to these questions is important because it becomes part of your “why.” It helps you get out of bed every day and handle the hard things in our business—the prospecting, dealing with constant rejection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=What is your legacy and what do you want to be remembered for?%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/do-you-know-what-you-want-your-legacy-to-be.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“What is your legacy and what do you want to be remembered for?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing your own obituary does something else important too—it makes you realize that life is finite. &lt;strong&gt;We’re all going to die someday, so you might as well be yourself and live your own life.&lt;/strong&gt; While writing my obituary, I realized that my legacy—or my “why”—was to know that one person lived a better life because I existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I take my team to the Bahamas every year for a vacation, and last year before we took this vacation I learned that one of my employees never had a passport. They’d never been outside of the U.S. before, and it was nice to think that if I never existed, they perhaps never would’ve had that passport or the chance to travel outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;strong&gt;think about what you want to be remembered for.&lt;/strong&gt; What will someone else write in your obituary? You don’t need to get a historical marker for yourself made, but if you think about what you want your legacy to be, it will change the way you do business and the way you think about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you’re curious about joining our team and what we can do for your career, give me a call so we can sit down and grab a  cup of coffee. I’d love to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Real Estate Coaching Advice: A New Perspective About Goal-Setting</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex17Q0MCJQs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re concerned about not meeting your goals exactly as you have set them, I have some advice for you that will hopefully help change your perspective and continue to grow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years in my business, I’ve learned a thing or two. So with my experience in mind, today I want to talk about goals and what’s really important about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t know, I’ve been training really intensely to run a marathon that’s coming up in about four weeks. &lt;strong&gt;My goal is to finish that marathon, but if I don’t, it’s not the end of the world for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not achieving the goal that’s important—it’s what the goal itself helps you to become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at my ideal weight, my heart rate is down to 59 BPM, I’ve increased my bench press limit by 40 lbs., and I’ve got more energy than ever. I feel great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s not about finishing the marathon, because none of those things will go away if I don’t. I’ve already won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why I advise you to set crazy goals for yourself next year.&lt;/strong&gt; If you set a goal to do 10 pushups, you’ll eventually hit that mark and collapse on the floor, exhausted. But suppose you set your goal for 100 pushups—you probably won’t hit that mark right away, but it will push you to work harder and think about your process. Any sort of improvement is a win in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It’s not achieving the goal that’s important—it’s what the goal itself helps you become.%20Realestatecareersinalbany.com/real-estate-coaching-advice-a-new-perspective-about-goal-setting.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It’s not achieving the goal that’s important—it’s what the goal itself helps you become.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an agent come into my office to talk about how they were concerned that they weren’t going to meet their yearly goals. My advice is to think about the process and what it would take to sell your goal number of homes. How would you do things differently? What would you do for prospecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guarantee that if you optimize your plan to reach your goal, you will absolutely end up selling more homes.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if it’s not the number you set for yourself, you’ll still improve and be a stronger agent for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need help with your goals, reach out to my team. I’d love to grab a coffee and speak with you about how you can become an even better agent.&lt;/p&gt;
