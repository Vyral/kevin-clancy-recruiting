<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Kevin Clancy and I’ve sold 2,000 of homes to date.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">I was blessed to met Kevin before getting my license. I have never worked for another brokerage and could not imagine being anywhere else. The unparalleled atmosphere drives you to succeed and not to mention the leads are consistently coming in as fast as you handle them.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Derek Devenpeck</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Prior to Team Clancy I was a struggling agent, since joining my business has increased dramatically! Kevin provides every agent leads, a personal business plan to reach your goals and first class marketing.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Wayne Carignan</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Working here is is being part of a team, not an office.  Everyone on the team is upbeat and wants to see the other members succeed.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Dave Greco</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">I love working on The Clancy Team! We have unlimited support. We all help each other! We are family! The leads we get and all the support we get from Kevin is amazing and unheard of in other Real Estate firms.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Jacki Moon</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Clancy real estate is the true team environment with everyone helping each other reach their goals.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Kristen Hess</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">I am so happy to be on a team that provides us with leads. I realized I was struggling and there is no need to. I am so thankful to be a part of Clancy Real Estate</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
