Why did I spend $400,000 on marketing in 2017? For starters, I got a great return.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

2018 is here and we’re off to a great start. Before we get too far into the new year, I wanted to make sure I talked to you about your marketing budget and what your plans are for it this year.

**I spent over $400,000 last year on marketing.** That might sound crazy, but when you see that my return was 4:1 at around $1.6 million, it doesn’t seem so crazy after all.

I track all of our spending on different marketing avenues. We’re always on the cutting edge and trying to use innovative techniques to get more business. One way we’re doing this is through a partnership with Regal Cinemas. Not only do our ads come up on the screens before movies, they also pop up on people’s phones in the theatre via a geolocation feature. **I can then track all my deals from this section of the budget.** When I can say that I spend “X” amount and brought in “Y” amount of money because of it, then my marketing makes sense from a profitability standpoint. Then it’s easy when it comes time to decide where to re-invest. I already know the places that have given me the best return, so I can go to them first.

If you don’t think you have a marketing budget, think again. Even if you’re just starting out, sending emails and making phone calls and sending thank you notes will barely cost you a thing.

**2018 is here and we’re excited for what the year has to bring.** If you want to learn more about where we spend our money when it comes to marketing or where you should be spending in order to maximize your return on investment, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to talk on the phone or meet up for a cup of coffee. I look forward to hearing from you.
