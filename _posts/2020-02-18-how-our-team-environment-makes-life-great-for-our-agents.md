Clancy Real Estate is all about: building people up to the point where they can live amazing lifestyles, make the money they want, and have fun in their careers. You can have all when you work with us.

I just hired a new agent out of a completely different field from real estate—a job with the federal government. He walked away from a federal pension and is completely underemployed; so why am I so excited?

Well, I want to help that agent who came on board and made a commitment to us to live an amazing lifestyle. I guarantee that I will help him earn double his federal income in a year of working with us. How am I going to do that? **By leveraging our tried-and-true systems and processes to your best advantage.**

The last agent I hired made $62,000 in her first six months with us, and she’ll easily make $120,000 in her first full year. When you work on a team that provides leads for you, that kind of success is possible.

Though we always think about leads, what about conversion rates? Here’s a quick story for you:

Last July, one of our agents had a lead come in. All we had was a name and an email; the agent followed up a dozen or so times. Nothing happened for the first 10 emails. Then the lead suddenly came to life. They had just put a $1.3-million home under contract on the buy-side and they had a $600,000 home to sell as well. **That’s almost $2 million in sales from sending just a dozen emails to a lead, or roughly 10 sales at the median home price in the Capitol region.**

That’s what Clancy Real Estate is about: building people up to the point where they can live amazing lifestyles, make the money they want, and have fun in their careers. When that happens, our clients achieve their goals and our agents achieve their goals. Everybody is happy.

There’s a lot going on in our industry right now; new firms and national franchises like eXp are entering and changing the market. With all these shifts, where do you go?

Not everything is perfect for everyone, but Clancy Real Estate is very competitive in the industry. Our agents are working towards their goals very well—in fact, **we’re working toward taking the entire team to the Bahamas at the end of 2020.**

If you want to work on a team that takes all-expenses-paid trips to an all-inclusive resort in the Bahamas, know that this will be our third year in a row traveling down there, and I’d love to talk to you about what working in a team environment can do for your life and career. Reach out and give us a call\! We can tell you all about what we’re doing and how we generate leads for our agents. There are no secrets here. From my heart of hearts, I want to see you succeed in this business.
