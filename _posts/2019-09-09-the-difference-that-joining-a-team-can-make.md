Summer is drawing to a close, which means fall is about to arrive. While this season might remind others of falling leaves and pumpkin spice, those of us in real estate know that this is the time of year when we must get serious about meeting our annual goals.&nbsp;

Now that the final quarter of the year is almost here, it’s time for agents to make that final push in attracting and converting business. We all want to be successful, but this is easier said than done.

With that said, it’s definitely possible. For example, one of my team’s newest agents has already made $30,000 after just three months of being with us. This got me thinking about my own experience. In my own first three months as an agent, I certainly wasn’t as successful as the agent I just mentioned. In fact, I don’t think I sold a single home.&nbsp;

Looking back, my path to success would have been much smoother had I joined a team. Most agents who are thriving today can attribute their success to working in a collaborative environment from the start. Teams offer leads, coaching, and other vital resources agents need to be productive.&nbsp;

When you work as part of a team, you’re able to focus on working with clients, rather than on back-end tasks like lead generation.

Teams are really the key to success in our industry today. I wish I had joined one sooner, myself.&nbsp;

If you want to see what a difference joining a team could make in your life and career, please give me a call. I’ve got an opening right now and would love to see whether you could be the right fit for this role.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
