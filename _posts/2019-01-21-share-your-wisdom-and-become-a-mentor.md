Mentoring doesn’t just help others. It helps you as well.

2019’s here! I hope you had a great holiday season and are looking forward to making this year your best one yet. Though we’re hearing all sorts of news about how the real estate market will be heading downward, we can persevere; if you work hard and maintain the basics, you’re going to be successful in real estate.

But today I want to focus on the one thing that could truly change your life this year: **mentoring someone.** I’ve been blessed in becoming a mentor to a young man who needs guidance in his life. Helping him has actually helped me more than I ever thought possible.

When you’re successful, it can be easy to forget about the rookies. **Take someone in your office who’s struggling and help them.** Tell them how you handled your early years. You’ll not only instill wisdom upon those who need it, but you’ll also learn a lot about yourself and your own business.

In David Goggins’ book, “Can’t Hurt Me,” he talks about an instructor who trained two people on how to open a blocked airway. A few days later in a skydiving incident, the instructor’s airway became clogged and he was unable to breathe. **He was then saved by the two people he had trained just two days prior.**

By mentoring others, the life we save is often our own. So I challenge you to take someone under your wing; what you’re truly giving is much, much more than advice. **And if you yourself are struggling, reach out to me and I’ll pull you up.** I want you to be successful, and with the great business we have in Albany real estate, we can all afford to help one another grow.

Contact me if you have any questions, have information, or simply need some help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
