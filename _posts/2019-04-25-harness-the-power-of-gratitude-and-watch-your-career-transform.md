Today I’ve got two incredible pieces of advice from real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, and each of them has the power to transform your career.

While shooting my latest commercial with Barbara Corcoran, she offered me some incredible advice. To paraphrase her words of wisdom, **“If you’re always grateful, you’ll always be successful.”**

This sentiment is one I think we should all strive to live by. It’s easy to focus on the things we don’t have, but it’s far more rewarding to remember the things you do have. It’s amazing how harnessing the power of gratitude can transform your life and career.&nbsp;

Of course, **your attitude and outlook must also be backed up by your actions.** Another piece of advice Barbara gave me was to offer value to my clients. Since she told me this, I’ve made it the main mission of my business, and I can’t recommend highly enough that all of you do the same.&nbsp;

The work it takes to offer this value is often difficult and will require you to go above and beyond, but **this short-term effort is well worth the long-term results.** If you follow this advice, your business is sure to thrive.
