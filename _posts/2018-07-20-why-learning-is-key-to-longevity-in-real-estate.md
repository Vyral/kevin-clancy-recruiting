<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The real estate business is constantly changing. Here’s why you need to be constantly learning unless you want to fall behind.</em></p>

I’m heading to Las Vegas to spend a week with Mike Ferry and I’m very much looking forward to it. If you haven’t been to a conference like this in a while, it’s time to hop on a plane and learn.

**My takeaway from agents that have staying power in this business is that they are constantly learning.** Here’s a quick story about that.

I filled in for one of my agents this week and went to a closing that I really knew nothing about. I ended up sitting next to the buyer’s agent and started chatting. This agent started in the business in 1972, when I was just 3 years old. I told them I was taking a few team members of mine out to Vegas and mentioned that I had an extra ticket for them if they were interested. It was three days before the event so I didn’t really think they would be interested, but she said she would love to go. **Long story short, she’s hopping on a plane and will be with us at the event.&nbsp;**

That speaks volumes to how this agent has been able to stay in the business for so long. If you’re not constantly learning like this, you’re going to fall behind. I love to learn, my team loves to learn, and **the day you think you know everything and stop learning is the day you start to die in this business.**

So, what are you doing to learn? There are so many new things in real estate that you can become an expert at. Just reading an hour a day can make you an expert on a field in just a few years.

**Not only are these events great for learning, they’re also great for networking**, which will also help you grow. I’m looking forward to learning, networking, and bringing back some great information for you all.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about your business, your career, or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
