<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you want to succeed in real estate, you need to get in the arena. Here’s what I mean by that.</em></p>

<em>“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.”</em> - Theodore Roosevelt&nbsp;

This quote changed my life, and I was reminded of it recently by witnessing three buyers this past week drop out of multiple-offer situations without even making an offer. These buyers really liked the homes for sale, but they didn’t want to get stuck in a bidding war.&nbsp;

It’s because of this quote that you as an agent need to ask yourself: **Are you in real estate because it’s a hobby, or are you in the arena?** In other words, are you actually playing the game and getting your hands dirty every single day?

When I started my business many years ago, there was one thought that drove me: I didn’t want to be on my deathbed wondering what would’ve happened if I tried starting a real estate business. I decided that I would rather start a business and potentially fail than regret never trying at all.&nbsp;

Many agents out there aren’t playing for keeps. They’re not giving the business their all. They’re not in the arena. Are you taking the time every day to get better? There’s a wealth of information out there that you can use to do so.&nbsp;

**If you want to succeed in real estate, you need to get in the arena.** This week, I hope you make the decision to step into the arena and make a plan that will lead you to your career goals.&nbsp;
