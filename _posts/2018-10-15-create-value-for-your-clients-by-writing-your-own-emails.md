<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you take the time to write your own material in the emails you send out to clients, you’ll be able to build your following much faster.</em></p>

When you send out emails to clients, are you writing them yourself or are you sending canned emails that you bought?&nbsp;

I’ve gotten a lot of emails lately from other Realtors about various topics that were all canned emails, and I want to let you in on a little secret: **People open emails for a reason.**&nbsp;There has to be something in it for them, and your tagline is super important in increasing your open rate&nbsp;

In 2012, I was named as the No. 1 Realtor in the Capital Region. How did I do it? Every Monday I would send out an email that I called the “Monday Morning Mojo,” which was a message of positive, observational thoughts I’d made over the previous week that didn’t really have anything to do with real estate.

When I first started sending these out, though, I was buying them canned. Two keys to success are self awareness and authenticity, and in my case, I wasn’t being authentic. When you’re not writing your own material, you’re not being authentic. Once I started writing my emails, I was able to generate a following that numbered in the thousands. People began to know me because of my emails. My open rate was about 80%, which is unheard of for an email blast. If you’d like to see an example of one of these emails, click here. &nbsp;

So, **instead of sending out canned emails that you bought, write something that actually provides knowledge and creates value for your clients.**&nbsp;

For example, after I’m finished with this video, I plan on shooting another video explaining to my clients why it’s important for both buyers and sellers to move quickly due to rising interest rates. As you may know, a 1% rise in interest rates decreases buyers’ purchasing power by 10%. It’s very important for buyers and sellers to know this, and it’s important that they take action before rates move further into the mid-5% range.

Also, don’t forget to personalize your email and make it hyper-local to your client’s area. If you do this, I guarantee that they’ll gravitate to you because you’re not sending them the same stuff that every other insurance broker, mortgage broker, or Realtor is sending them.

As always, if you have any questions about this topic or you’d like to talk more about it with me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. And remember—my team is growing, so if you want to know what it’s like to make six figures and be on a team where all leads are provided, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking with you.
