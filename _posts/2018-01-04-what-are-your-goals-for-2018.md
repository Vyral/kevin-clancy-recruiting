If you want to be successful in 2018, write down your goals—what you’re willing to change and what you’re willing to give up to achieve those goals.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

The new year has arrived, so I hope you have your business plan in place for 2018. If you don’t, it’s not too late.

January is a time of change, so the question is: **What are you going to do differently in 2018 that you didn’t do in 2017 to achieve your goals?**

I’m fortunate because my team had a great 2017. We hit Las Vegas for training, we hit Chicago for training, and we hit the Bahamas just for fun. I’m blessed to have some great guys in my life.

If your 2017 wasn’t like ours, what are you going to do differently? I signed a deal today that will change things for us in 2018. It’s a big deal for us—it could make or break us, but we’re changing things. We’re not resting on our laurels—we're changing things going forward.

If you’re on a team and you’re not happy, call me. We have open spots on our team for two new members, and we’re looking for people who want to make six figures. I want two people who want to have fun and look forward to coming to work every day in an environment that’s fun to work in. I look forward to every single work day.

**If you want to be successful, write down your goals** — what you’re willing to change and what you’re willing to give up to achieve those goals. Do this, and you’ll get there. If you need help, we’re happy to oblige. We’re a goal-oriented culture, and we love helping other Realtors.

If you have any other questions or would like to sit down and chat about real estate over a cup of coffee, call or email me anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
