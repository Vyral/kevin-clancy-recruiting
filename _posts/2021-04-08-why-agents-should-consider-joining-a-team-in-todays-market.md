In the 30 years I’ve been in the real estate industry, I’ve never seen a market this tough. There’s still plenty of money to be made and plenty of business being done, but you may not be seeing that firsthand. **If you’re struggling in this difficult market, how do you compete?**

I went on a listing appointment the other day, and I ended up seeing eight different agents there trying to secure the seller as a client. The reality is that that seller will end up choosing whichever agent provides the highest price and the lowest commission. It’s not necessarily the kind of client we want as a firm, so we walked away from the deal. So, again, how do you compete when some sellers just go with the lowest commission?

I spoke with an agent from another firm the other day, and the agent wanted to build their brand instead of joining the team. Frankly, I think you need to be on a team during this market environment in order to secure leads. If you really want to build a brand, why? Is your motivation to make money, have a great life, and work fewer hours, or do you just want the pride of having a brand?

I put a lot of money into building my brand, and there are both good things and bad things about that. I will say that one of my agents yesterday set five listing appointments yesterday through inbound calls, and that was accomplished through my brand. **If your brand isn’t getting these kinds of results, you may want to consider whether it’d be better to join a team.&nbsp;**

If you think a team would be a better option, let’s talk—I have spots for two people who can provide exemplary service and are looking to work full-time for a six-figure income. Our agents are able to build their own business within our team, allowing them to have the perks without doing the heavy lifting.

If you’re interested in joining our team, please feel free to reach out to me to learn more. You can contact me at **518-461-9937**. I’d be happy to tell you exactly what we can offer you, how our systems work, and how you can grow your career as an agent. Until then, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
