Are you interested in serving your community? If so, there are two opportunities I’d like to go over with you today.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

Before I get into today’s main topic, I’ve got a huge opportunity for you. My company is always doing everything we can to give back to the community that gives us so much, and right now we’re looking for two agents to join us in doing so. **If you want to make six figures and work on a team with a culture that values both hard work and having fun, please give me a call.**

I’m offering a $1,000 bonus to you or someone you know who is interested in joining our team. This bonus will become available as soon as you close your first transaction.

Now, let’s move onto the main subject. There is an event put on by the St. Baldrick’s Foundation, a private charity and childhood cancer research foundation, coming up March 11 at the Westmere Fire Department. **You can see a video message from St. Baldricks at the 2:45 mark in the video above.**

This is an event my team and I have been happy to support every year. Also, if you or someone you refer to us join our team, we will personally donate $2,000 to St. Baldrick’s after you close your first transaction.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
