<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you want to succeed in real estate, you can’t always take the path of least resistance. Here’s why.</em></p>

As you probably already know, water always takes the path of least resistance. And **in that same way, many people enter the real estate industry because of its low barrier of entry.** You simply take a class and then you’re in.&nbsp;

Of course, this doesn’t mean every agent who enters the business is good at what they do. I recently had to let one of my team members go for this exact reason. You can’t “go with the flow” if you want to be successful in real estate.

Take, for example, another agent on my team. In contrast to the agent I just mentioned, this individual has made over $20,000 within just six weeks of being on my team. Why? Because **she chose to swim against the current, rather than simply letting herself be carried along.**&nbsp;

This agent is in a minority within our industry, though. Too many agents assume that having a license is enough. I just interviewed three individuals with this exact mindset, and this was one of the main reasons I decided against welcoming them to the team.

**If you’re one of the few agents out there who is willing to put in the work to carve your own path but you’re struggling to make this happen on your own, please reach out to me.** If you’ve got what it takes, I’d be happy to help you start producing at the level you’re capable of.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
