If you’re not holding yourself accountable in your business, you need to find someone to do it for you.

Who holds you accountable in your business?

This is a question that was posed to me recently by a real estate coach, and it’s an interesting one because right now is the first time I haven’t had a real estate coach in eight or 10 years.

Us Realtors hire coaches to hold us accountable for tasks we need to complete each week. Otherwise, there’s no accountability in our business—there’s no one telling you to get out of bed, get to the office, and get things done. In real estate, you’re an independent contractor. If you want to sleep in until 10 a.m. every day, you can do so (you probably won’t be in the business very long though).

I was listening to the audiobook version of “The 5 Second Rule” recently, and the book’s premise is that you have five seconds to act on something, and **your role is to be a parent to yourself.** A parent’s role is to help their children grow and excel, but their role is also to get them to do things they generally won’t do on their own, so being a parent to yourself is what accountability is all about.

This week, think about who holds you accountable. **If you’re not holding yourself accountable and you’re not self-motivated, get an accountability partner.** On our team, everybody has an accountability partner.

If you need help being accountable, call me and I would be happy to use our systems and processes to hold you accountable and get your career on track. Otherwise, call a real estate coach.

If you have any other questions or you’re interested in joining our team, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
