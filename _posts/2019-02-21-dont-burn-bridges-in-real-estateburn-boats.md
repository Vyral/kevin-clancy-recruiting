<p style-"text-align: center;"><em>To succeed in this industry, you have to burn your boats. Let me tell you what that means.</em></p>

In real estate, you don’t want to burn your bridges. However, you do want to burn your boats.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, I know I’ve burned bridges before in my career. I want to win clients and do my best for them, but my approach has sometimes been a bit too short-sighted. In real estate, though we compete with fellow agents, we often need to collaborate as well. Albany is small—you’re going to be doing business with agents more than once, **so you simply can’t burn bridges.**

In 1519, Cort&eacute;s invaded the island of Veracruz and burned his own army’s boats. They knew that they’d either win or die—**there was no turning back.** Real estate is the same way: You have to make a commitment.

There was a top RE/MAX agent who had a great business in contracting and carpentry, but he decided to become a real estate agent. He could have simply dabbled in the industry, relying primarily on his previous trade while he built his real estate business. Instead, he sold his tools, made a full commitment, and became a top agent. **That’s exactly what you need to do in real estate.**

I’m afraid of heights, but I still went skydiving. I was terrified, but when I finally jumped out of the plane, I had made a commitment that there was no turning back from. **And after making that commitment, I was at peace.** If you really want to find ultimate success in real estate, you need to commit to becoming a professional. We’re currently hiring, so if you’re ready to commit to your future in the industry, now’s your best chance to make it happen.
