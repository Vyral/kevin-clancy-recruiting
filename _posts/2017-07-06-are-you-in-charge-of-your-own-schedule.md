Do you have a dedicated, set schedule? If you are disciplined with your time, you will be more successful as a real estate agent.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

One of the most important things as a real estate agent is your schedule. To be a successful agent, it’s incredibly important that you are disciplined and able to manage your time.

So, if you don’t have any appointments on a Monday morning, what will you do? What is your schedule?

My most successful agents will get up, get dressed, come into the office and start prospecting. **They make connections every single day, which is the key to success.**

I have guys coming into my office in T-shirts and flip flops. When I ask if they have the day off, they say, “Oh no, I’m working.” I know that some people enjoy that laid-back style, but it’s just mind-boggling to me. If you are a professional, then you need to dress like a professional. I think that is so important in our industry.

Have a disciplined schedule and show up. That is the key to success in our industry. After all, real estate is a contact sport. You need to have a schedule and prospect for two to three hours every single day. If you do that, then you can’t help but make $200,000 to $300,000 a year.

**If you don’t have appointments, are you showing up to prospect?** Are you disciplined enough to control your time, or do your clients control your time? When one of your clients calls you, do you run out for a showing or are you disciplined enough to make sure that your sacred prospecting time does not get interrupted?

When I first started out, my sacred time was 8:30 to 10:30 or 11:00 a.m. I would prospect every single morning.

As time has gone on, that changed. Now, we do a lot more inbound calls or call follow-up. Still, it’s incredibly important to have that set schedule. Set aside family time, time for home showings, and time for prospecting so that you can get what you want out of life. That way, you’re not reacting and running around at the whim of your clients.

So this week, think about drawing out your schedule. Personally, I’m in the office almost every morning to return emails and make follow-up calls. My appointments are in the afternoon. As our company has grown, I no longer have to take weekend or evening appointments, so I’m able to devote that time to my family.

**Control your schedule.** By being disciplined with your time, you will set yourself up for a successful career.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be more than happy to help you!
