Today I’m excited to share with you what I know about how to choose a CRM. It’s a question I’ve received time and time again, and one that I’ve asked many times myself. The truth is: you really need two.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

Today I wanted to answer a question for you that I’m always receiving: what lead and CRM systems do I use?

Now, I get this question over and over again. I’ve used most of the systems out there but, interestingly enough, I ask that same question to my friends who are incredibly successful in real estate. I’ve learned that the answer is always different.

They tell me they’re using Agent Office, Top Producer, Boom town, Commissions Inc—the list goes on. With all this variety, the truth I got out of all these answers combined was this: **use what works for you and, if you have a team, what works for them.**

Myself, I’ve been on Top Producer more than ten years, and from personal experience I can tell you that while there may always be a better, more efficient program out there compared to the one you’re using, the real secret is knowing which is the best for you personally.

My good friend Howard, who started Tiger leads, is a CRM expert. With how quickly systems change over the course of time, Howard makes a good point: **you really need two CRMs in your business** — one for the now business to follow up with your buyers and sellers, and one like Top Producer, which will follow up with your contacts after you sell the home.

Despite all the advertisements I run as a Realtor, 40% of my business is from referrals. This is because we keep in touch with things like our monthly mail-out newsletter, bimonthly emails, and other miscellaneous touches we add for our clients throughout the year.

The fact of the matter is that if you’re looking to grow your business, you need to invest in CRMs.

I’ve personally spoken with the owners of several programs including Commissions Inc, Boom Town, Tiger Leads, and more, and I know how important it is to get your contacts into a database so you can connect with your clients and grow your business.

If you’re looking for more information about CRMs or have any questions in general that I can help you out with, give me a call or send me an email. You can also feel free to get in touch if you or someone you know would be interested in joining our growing team. I look forward to hearing from you.
