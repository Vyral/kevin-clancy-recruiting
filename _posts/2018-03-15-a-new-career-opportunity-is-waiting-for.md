I’m on the lookout for a new agent to join my team.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

Right now, I’m looking for a highly qualified, full-time real estate agent with a minimum of two years of experience to join my team.

On average, I receive 200 to 300 buyer leads per month, and I need your help to handle the surplus of buyers calling my office daily. **I want to help you take your career to the next level and focus on what you do best, which is selling homes.**

As one of the top real estate agents in Albany, I can guarantee that you’ll make $75,000 in your first year or I’ll pay you the difference.

Join me, the Capital Region’s No. 1 real estate agent as voted by the readers of The Times Union, and the only agent that real estate mogul and “Shark Tank” star Barbara Corcoran recommends in Albany.

If you’re interested in applying or you have any other questions, give me a call or message me here on our website. I look forward to hearing from you.
