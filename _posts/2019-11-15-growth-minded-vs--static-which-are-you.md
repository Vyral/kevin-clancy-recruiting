Now that I’m back from Zillow Unlock 2019, it’s time to talk about a couple of important issues that were addressed at this conference. The first is Zillow, itself. The second is the difference between a growth-oriented agent and a static one.&nbsp;

I know everyone likes to rag on Zillow, but if you’re not using Zillow in your business, I think you’re making a mistake. I’ll let you in on a little secret: We Realtors always like to say how Zillow doesn’t know whether a home has updated features or not, but guess what? Now it does. Their new valuation tool can recognize whether a home has updated features, and this will change the face of real estate. They also have an iBuyer program they’re introducing that can make instant offers on houses.&nbsp;

If you’re not paying attention to these kinds of things, you’ll get left behind, because the industry is changing rapidly. If you’d like to know more about the evolution of Zillow or how it can help your business, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to discuss this topic further with you.

Now, regarding my second point, I have an important question to ask you: **Are you growth-oriented or static?**

A static agent is someone who always says, “I am.” In other words, “I am a great prospector,” or “I am an expert in my market.” A growth-oriented agent is someone who says, “I can.” They’re always growing and always learning.&nbsp;

There’s a big difference in our industry between a static and growth-oriented mindset. I’ve been in the business for 30 years, and I’m always reading, watching webinars, attending masterminds, and doing everything else I can to learn and be the best I can be. Someone with a static mindset would just assume they knew everything there was to know about the business after being a Realtor for 30 years.

**If you’re a growth-oriented agent, I guarantee you’ll make more money, have a more successful career, and be happier than someone with a static mindset.**&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about this topic or you’re looking to join a team that has more leads than we know what to do with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
