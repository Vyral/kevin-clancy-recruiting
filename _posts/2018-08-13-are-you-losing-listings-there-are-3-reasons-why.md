There are three main reasons why agents lose out on listings even after going on appointments. Being able to identify and avoid each will be essential to your success.

I recently spent a week in Vegas for a fantastic training seminar with Mike Ferry, and while I was there, I noticed something: **A lot of people want wealth and success, but few people want to put in the work to earn it.** Playing the slot machines is one thing, but working in real estate is another. As you probably already know, being a successful real estate professional requires a lot of hard work.&nbsp;

So what happens if you’re already putting in the work but aren’t seeing the results you want? This is what I’ll be talking about today. Specifically, I’d like to highlight the three main reasons why you’re losing listings even going on numerous appointments.&nbsp;

<br>**1. You lack energy.** There’s nothing worse than going into a listing appointment devoid of enthusiasm. Always show up prepared, excited, and with a smile on your face.

**2. You don’t know the market.** If you don’t know and understand recent statistics about your local real estate market, it’s time to study up. Learning the market is essential.&nbsp;

<br>**3. You aren’t asking questions.** Your clients don’t care about your endorsements and awards. They care about reaching their goals. So when you meet with clients, make it about them. Ask them as many questions as it takes to discern whether what they want is really the right move for them. If you honestly believe they will be better off renting for a while, tell them that. Never take on a transaction that isn’t in the client’s best interest.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
