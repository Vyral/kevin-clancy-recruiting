<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As an agent, do you walk the walk, or do you talk the talk?</em></p>

We have a brand-new agent on our team who has only had her license for about four weeks now. In that time with us, she has put four homes under contract. She’s absolutely killing it\!

I’m sure you’re wondering, “How did she do that?”

Well, my team has the systems in place to help our agents sell some 50 or 60 homes each year, but success like this ultimately comes down to your answer to this question: **As an agent, do you walk the walk, or do you talk the talk?**

I guarantee that 99% of you (including myself) did not put four homes under contract in your first four weeks in the business. **But this agent has one key quality: She’s coachable.** She doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but she does take our advice to heart and put it into practice.

I told her in the beginning that if she made 40 calls a day, she could make $150,000 a year on our team. And so, being coachable, that was the goal she set for herself. Last month, **she showed 44 homes and ended up putting four under contract**, which is a great ratio.

So, if you aren’t tracking the number of showings it takes to get a sale or the number of calls it takes to get an appointment, **you need to start.** Our superstar agent knows her numbers—she definitely walks the walk. &nbsp;She’s on track to sell 50 homes this year\!

In the end, you can’t just talk about making your calls, sending emails, or texting your leads. You actually have to do it. If you’re not prospecting, if you’re not generating leads, and if you don’t have the people to call, then we need to talk. I want to help you succeed. My goal is to have everyone on my team making almost six figures every year, and if you walk the walk on the Clancy Real Estate Team, you could too. If this sounds good to you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me anytime.

Hope to hear from you soon\!
