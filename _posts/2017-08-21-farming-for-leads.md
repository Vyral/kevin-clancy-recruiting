Today I wanted to talk about how best to farm neighborhoods in your area for leads.

I’m very excited to announce that my real estate team ranked 181 out of the top 1,000 real estate teams in the country, according to The Wall Street Journal. Even more exciting is that we ranked third in the entire state of New York. I couldn’t more proud of the work my team has accomplished this past year.

Today I wanted to talk about farming neighborhoods as the supply of homes is so low. We’ve been doing quite a bit of farming for leads with direct mail using Every Door Direct with the US Postal Service.

You want to pick a neighborhood that has an above-average turnover rate and is in a nearby area that’s easy for you to service. **You want to make sure the neighborhood has a price point that’s reasonable, as well.** It’s easy to find information online for neighborhoods that are likely to have a high turnover rate.

This past 4th of July, we handed out about 2,000 American flags in the neighborhoods we were farming. I had my two teenage daughters help by sticking the flags in the yard and leaving a door hanger on the front door. We didn’t knock on the door since we didn’t want to bother any residents over the holiday, but we’re likely going to see about four contracts from that. It’s still too early to tell, but the results so far look promising.

We try to get creative with our mailings with things like lottery tickets, seed packets, and handwritten thank you notes— **and the results speak for themselves.**

If you have any questions on what we do to farm for leads or are looking for other farming ideas, please give me a call. I’d be happy to help!
