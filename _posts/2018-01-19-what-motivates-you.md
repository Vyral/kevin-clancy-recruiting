To stay motivated in this business, you need to find out what your purpose is in life beyond the money.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

How do you stay motivated? Why do you do what you do?

You can say things like “I want to pay for my kid’s college education,” or “I want a new kitchen,” or “I want a new car,” and that’s fine. The money is great—we all do it for the money. If you’re not making a lot of money, this business really stinks.

**You need more than that, though.** A couple weeks ago, my team and I had our annual kick-off luncheon, and the point I made there was that we needed a bigger vision as a company. We needed a bigger “why” in our lives than just making money. Our vision has to be about helping people and making a difference in their lives. That’s what we’re about as a company.

Tony Robbins puts this outlook into perspective by laying out a specific hypothetical scenario. Imagine there’s a fortress hiding a room containing $1 million in cash, and around that fortress is a moat filled with alligators, barbed wire, machine guns, etc. Are you going to swim through that alligator-infested moat to get that $1 million? Probably not.

Now, if you alter that scenario and put something you truly love—perhaps a spouse, a sibling, or a son or daughter—-in that same room inside that fortress that used to hold $1 million, will you risk your life swimming through the alligator-infested moat then? You probably will. That’s because that person means so much more to you than money.

This week, as you gear up to work through the typically slow months of January and February and wait for spring to come, **narrow down your “why.”** Ask yourself, what is your purpose in life? Why do you get out of bed? Why do you sell real estate? What do you love about it?

Some of my team members and I volunteered at a Ronald McDonald house recently, and it really changed our perspective. We went down there to help those guys, but in the end, they helped us because they taught us so much about the struggles other people go through and how much they need us to help them. We met a family who had a daughter with leukemia, and they have to be in the hospital every single day. When you hear stories like theirs, you realize that the struggles we encounter in real estate are nowhere near the struggles other people go through.

**As a company, our “why” is giving back to our community that supports us so much.** What about you, though? What is it that will make you make those extra 10 calls per week? That “why” is so important. Once you find it, it’s an amazing and empowering thing.

If you have any questions about finding your “why” or you ever want to know what it’s like to be on a team where all leads are provided and everybody works together to foster a supportive, loving environment, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to talk to you.
