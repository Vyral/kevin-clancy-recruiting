Today I want to tell you the secret of how my team sells so many homes. A big part of what we do is about our environment.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

People frequently ask me how my team is able to sell so many homes. Today, I thought I’d share the answer with all of you.

As you may know, **we’ve been ranked as the third top team in all of New York State by The Wall Street Journal.** Not only that, but my team members average about 30 sales each.

To illustrate how we’re able to achieve this, I’d like to depart from real estate for a moment. This morning on my run, I noticed that my mile time was 30 seconds faster than it had been earlier in the week.

I was surprised by this and found myself wondering what had happened. Nothing had changed about my routine. But it was then that I realized that **something truly had changed—my environment.**

Earlier in the week I was running on hot, humid mornings. However, the weather was much nicer on the day I noticed that improvement in my mile time.

Environment really does matter. This is true for real estate, as well. The success of my team is in part due to our environment. The team-based environment that we foster with our shared ideas and mutual investment in our goals is a key factor in our success.

When you’re searching for success in your own endeavors, ask yourself what kind of environment you are in.

Next, you need to ask yourself if you’ve made a commitment. Everyone on my team is full-time and they are all constantly striving for self-improvement.

Your skill set is the one thing that will really differentiate you in the business of real estate. **Making a commitment to be at your best will pave your path to higher achievement.** If you treat something like a hobby, you’ll never see the kind of results you might expect from a career.

**Our team is expanding, so if you’d like to know what it’s like to work on a team, I’d love to get together and talk.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
