<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Let us help you make 2020 your best year ever in real estate.</em></p>

What do you plan to do differently in 2020? If you didn’t hit your goals or have the most amazing year ever this past year, what are you going to do differently in 2020 to ensure its the best it could be?

Oftentimes in real estate, we’re looking to buy our way to success—buying more leads, implementing the latest CRM, getting more leads from Zillow, and so on.

However, that’s not the way we’re going to find success in this industry. **Success in real estate comes from internal changes like mastering our scripts and knowing our numbers.** Success can also come from the environment around you. In order for you to change, the pain of staying where you are must be greater than the pain of moving.

So consider this: Is your environment conducive to your success? Are you surrounded by agents who are selling up to 50 homes a year? The person in the office next to mine says he’s going to sell 65 homes by the end of 2019.

**Success leaves clues, and when you surround yourself with greatness in an environment conducive to success, magical things can happen.** This applies to more than just real estate, though; it also applies to your financial situation, your faith, your relationships, and most other aspects of your life. Whatever it is you’ve been unhappy with this year, now’s the time to lay the groundwork to make 2020 your best year ever.

If you need help to plan or achieve your goals or want to know what it’s like to work on a team where all the leads are provided to you and you have a 24/7 coach who’s committed to your success, give me a call or send an email. We can help you lay the groundwork for a better 2020.
