You can’t find success in real estate on your own. You need to learn from others and apply that to your own career. Here’s how I can help you do that.

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.


I’m back to share some more ideas and insights that I’ve gathered in my 25+ years in the business. I’m heading down to meet with some top agents in the next week which got me thinking about the keys to success.

Why do I travel to so many conferences like this? **Because I want to surround myself with greatness.** I like being in places where I’m not the smartest guy in the room. You need to surround yourself with successful people too. It will help you start thinking bigger.

You have an obligation to succeed. **To yourself, to your family, and to the ones you love.** Teddy Roosevelt once said, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” However, it also works in reverse. If you’re in an office with average agents who sell five or six homes per year, you might be feeling really great if you have sold eight homes, but you shouldn’t.

My team sold 300 homes last year, but we stink. You know why? 6,000 homes were sold in the capital region last year. **Our market share is so small and there is so much opportunity for us.** The abundance of business is amazing.

If you’re not happy where you are in your career, give me a call. I’d be happy to go out for coffee, have a sit-down, and show you the path to true success in this industry. My goal in life is to grow people, and I’d love to do the same with you.

There’s more business out there for everyone, so that’s why I’m offering you this opportunity. **If you’re interested in going to Mike Ferry’s superstar retreat for free, give me a call and I’ve got a free ticket for you.** Mike is one of the best minds in real estate and this will absolutely change your life.
