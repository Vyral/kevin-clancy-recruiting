<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you have a negative attitude about working in the real estate business, you should probably consider looking into another career. Here’s why.</em></p>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

If you’re a real estate agent and you don’t feel as if we work in the greatest business in the world, you should consider looking into another career.&nbsp;

I say this because I recently came across several posts on the Capital Region Real Estate Agents Facebook group, and 60% of them were negative posts that complained about what other Realtors were doing.&nbsp;

Well, guess what? We’re in the greatest business in the world at the greatest possible time. **Technology is increasing our efficiency and making it so much easier to do our jobs than it was 10 or even five years ago.** Yet, we’re still complaining.&nbsp;

Here’s the thing—we’ll always have to work and collaborate with competitors. That’s just the way our industry is, and we have to get used to it. You’ll never see me complain about the real estate business because I consider myself blessed to be in this industry. We get paid a tremendous amount of money to put the key in the door.

When I started my career, I had very little experience. However, I still got listings because of my enthusiasm. I was always energetic and grateful for the opportunity to sit in someone’s kitchen and agree to list their home.&nbsp;

There is no other industry in the world where, if you have no inventory, you can simply pick up the phone, make some calls, and increase your inventory for free. If you have nothing to sell, you can just call some expired listings or FSBOs and change your situation. It doesn’t get any easier than that.&nbsp;

It’s a gift to be able to do what we do. We don’t need inventory, employees, or anything else most businesses in other industries need. We don’t even need a physical location to do our jobs. But, some of us still constantly look at the negative side of things and complain about how hard the business is.

At the end of the day, all we have to do is be honest and be willing to pick up the phone and we can make a tremendous amount of money. Where else can you make $200,000 in your first or second year in the business?

If you don’t feel this way, I think you’re doing something wrong, so try having a positive attitude going forward. Don’t focus on negative things. Be grateful that you’re in the greatest industry in the world. **This attitude will reflect on your clients, your conversion rate will improve, and you’ll have more fun and a better career.**

As always, if you’d like to discuss this topic with me or you’d like to know more about my team and how we do business, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
