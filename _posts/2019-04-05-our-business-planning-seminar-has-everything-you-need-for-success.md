If your business has been struggling, our upcoming event can turn it all around.

The spring market’s here, and I hope you’re staying busy out there! It’s a great market, and if you’re not finding some great business, something is wrong. If you’ve found you’re unable to take advantage of these multiple-offer situations and new listings, we need to talk and figure out what you should be doing.

**Speaking of which, we have a great business-planning seminar coming up!** Join me at my office on April 30 to learn how to get a plan in place for growing your business and reaching a six-figure income. To sign up for this invaluable learning opportunity,[ click this Eventbrite link.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/3-hour-albany-real-estate-agent-business-planning-workshop-tickets-59073108257?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new_event_email&amp;utm_term=viewmyevent_button){: target="_blank"} It’s only $49.95 to attend, but you can **get in for free if you type in this code: VIP.&nbsp;**

My own business is growing in a lot of ways as well, and things are going great for my team. Just the other day, I found a company that would reach out to my old leads. They started texting them, and within 15 minutes, I had 15 responses. **Three of them were buyers who were ready to start the home search!**

That came from the 150 leads I uploaded. **I have 18,000 altogether.** Think about how much opportunity is still in that database, waiting to be turned into clients for my real estate business. This texting company works great, and agents should definitely have some sort of system in place. If this approach sounds interesting to you, I’d be more than happy to talk with you about it more and show you what’s working for our team.

If you have any questions or would like more information about the event or my team’s processes, feel free to reach out to me. Until then, I look forward to seeing you at the seminar!
