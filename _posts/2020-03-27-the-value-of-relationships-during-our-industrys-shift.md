<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’re going through a shift in our industry due to the coronavirus pandemic, and if you want to make it through to the other side, you need to do one powerful thing.</em></p>

As you might know, we’re currently under an executive order and we can’t do real estate the traditional way for the moment, though we can do virtual home tours, call existing clients, and other activities that can be done remotely and safely.

Given the times, it’s important to understand that we’re going through a shift, and things will be different on the other side. **There are around 4,000 agents in the Capital region, and we’ll likely lose around half of them.**

That’s why you need to pivot now: Position your business and take care of your clients as best you can right now. At the moment, we’re not doing sales calls but rather just calling clients to thank them for their support and offering to return the favor.

If you want to remain successful in our business, **touch base with all your clients and let them know how much your relationship with them means to you.** Remember: The greatest things in life aren’t things at all—they’re relationships, love, and friendships, and they’re free.

I realized early on in my career that my life is just about making a difference, so if I can help you in any way, reach out to me. I’m here for you. In the meantime, remember that we live in the greatest country in the world and **things will turn around in the end.**
