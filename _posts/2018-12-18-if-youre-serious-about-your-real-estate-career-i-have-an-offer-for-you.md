Are you serious about your real estate career? In that case, I have an opportunity for you.

Now that the holidays are here, I have an opportunity to share with you and I want to talk a little about what’s happening in our industry.&nbsp;

Did you know that, in terms of the number of Realtors in our industry, we’re peaking? Over the next 18 to 24 months, though, **we’re going to lose a lot of them as the market starts to shift.** That’s just an unfortunate part of the cycle our industry goes through.

In the last month, I’ve had multiple people contact me looking for a job. The conversations I’ve had with them, though, usually involve them asking, “What can you offer me?” That’s the funny part about real estate—in what other industry would you call an employer and ask them what they can offer you?&nbsp;

Last week, I interviewed someone who I knew within 30 seconds wouldn’t be a good fit for my company, but sure enough, the next day they told me they were considering taking the position. I had to remind them, of course, that I hadn’t even offered them the position yet. We’re a bit more selective than that when it comes to who we hire.&nbsp;

That being said, here’s my gift I want to offer you: If you’re serious about your career, come talk to me. I guarantee that if you’re hired, you will make at least $25,000 a year. If you don’t, I’ll personally write you a check for that amount. **If you stick to our team’s regimen and follow our lead generation systems, you’ll not only make more money, but you’ll work fewer hours and have less stress.&nbsp;**

However, you need to be the right person for the job. There’s no barrier for entry into our business, and a lot of people get into thinking they’ll be driving a Mercedes 550 and making a few hundred grand a year without actually working. As we know, the reality is far different. **Real estate is a great career, but it takes work.**&nbsp;

If you’re interested in this opportunity, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you have an absolutely fantastic holiday with your family.
