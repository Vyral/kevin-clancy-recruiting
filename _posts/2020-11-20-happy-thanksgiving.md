Friends,

The 2020 holiday season has officially begun\! We hope you are as excited as we are.&nbsp;

**We’d like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of you this Thanksgiving.** We have met some truly wonderful people, and we’re proud to have helped so many reach their real estate goals over the years.&nbsp;

*We wouldn’t be where we are today without all of your support.&nbsp;*

Enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner—that’s what we plan to do\!&nbsp;

**In the meantime,** please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any real estate questions. We would be happy to help you.&nbsp;

Happy Thanksgiving,&nbsp;

Kevin Clancy
