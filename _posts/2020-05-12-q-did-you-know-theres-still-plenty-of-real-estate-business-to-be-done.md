<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Homes are still selling, and now’s a great time to focus on your business.</em></p>

There is a ton of misinformation out there about the COVID-19 pandemic and what we agents can and can’t do in our business. As a broker, I have a duty to my team to make sure we’re abiding by the rules and meeting all guidelines, and this brings me to the point I want to share today: **We’re still selling real estate.&nbsp;**

I get disheartened because it seems like we’re spending more time worrying about getting unemployment insurance when there’s real estate business being done, and your time is infinitely better spent working on your real estate business instead of trying to get unemployment insurance.&nbsp;

I hate to say it, but there’s a victim mentality spreading and people assume nothing is going on, but you know what? Real estate is still happening.I recently came across the story of someone who spent six hours on the phone trying to secure unemployment insurance. That system is set up to handle a thousand calls a day, and right now they’re getting a million calls a day, so it’s all too easy to get frustrated in this situation.&nbsp;

If you can see yourself doing this, take those six hours and spend them calling your sphere of influence. **Call your current and potential clients and let them know what’s going on in the market.** One of my newest agents who has been an agent for less than a year recently sold five homes in six days. Unemployment insurance will pay you $900 per week if you're lucky. This agent made $18,000 in one week, and she did it all virtually.

If you still want to file for unemployment insurance, I understand, but I think your time is better spent focusing on what you want your business to look like—how you plan on acquiring business, what your pillars of lead generation look like, etc. There are a multitude of things you could work on during this time. Right now, I’m cleaning up my database, and my team is focusing on getting homes sold. In the week leading up to this video, we closed 12 of them.&nbsp;

**Real estate is a contact sport, so get on the phone and start prospecting.** As you can see in the video above, I’m wearing a sports coat. I don’t have to but I am because it’s business as usual, in a virtual environment.&nbsp;

If you’re struggling in your business and not seeing any activity, give me a call. My team and I are getting more leads than ever, and we’re having great conversations with buyers and sellers. If you have questions about other real estate topics or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to give me a call as well. I’m here to help.
