<p style="text-align: center;"><em>With the holidays just around the corner and our market slowing down, now is the time to remain persistent.</em></p>

As you probably remember from some of my recent messages, I recently ran my first marathon. And I’ve got to tell you, it was a challenge. Around the sixth or seventh mile into the race, things started getting really tough. Even so, one concept kept me going: persistence.&nbsp;

**As real estate professionals, this is the same concept we need to apply right now.** The holidays are just around the corner, activity has been slowing down, and, around this time of year, a lot of mediocre agents out there start feeling a little shaken.&nbsp;

Looking at what might lie ahead for our market, it can be easy to feel intimidated. But just like I told myself after completing the first few miles of that marathon, now is the time to remain persistent.&nbsp;

**No matter how many times you get knocked down, you’ve got to keep getting up.** Now is not the time to start questioning what you’re doing. Think about your target and stick to it.&nbsp;

To illustrate the importance of this, I’d like to share another quick story. I’ve got two friends who were both farming for leads. One kept talking about how successful his farm was and how well he was doing. The other agent, who had been farming his area for the same amount of time, was insistent that the first agent’s method just wouldn’t work in his market. In truth, this was just an excuse.&nbsp;

The first agent was sending out 10,000 mailers and the other was sending out 500. On a percentage basis, their response rate was identical, but the agent who was sending out 10,000 mailers, obviously, was doing far better. **The only difference between the two of them was their level of effort.**

It takes massive action to achieve massive results. It takes persistence to succeed.&nbsp;

Of course, I wouldn’t be telling you this if I didn’t care. I understand that with the holidays coming up, it can be a difficult time of year for many. It isn’t always easy to remain persistent. So, in addition to offering the advice I’ve shared today, I’d also like to let you know that if you happen to be alone this Thanksgiving, my table has a place for you. **I can’t promise the quality of my cooking will be particularly amazing, but I can promise it will be a great time.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
