<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Those who say that Zillow is ruining the real estate industry really don’t know what they’re talking about. Here’s why.</em></p>

I go on listing appointments every day and talk to agents every day who are down on Zillow and think it’s ruining our industry. However, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with top executives from Zillow in D.C. as well as the CEO of Century 21 and former Zillow Executive Nick Bailey. **I actually love Zillow and what it’s doing for the industry. Here’s why.**

Those who hate Zillow because of their inaccuracies when it comes to valuing homes point to the fact that their standard deviation is about 13% off from actual home value. **However, you don’t want that Zestimate to be spot on as an agent.** If it’s 100% right, your value add as an agent gets diminished. What does a buyer or seller need from you if they can just get the actual value from Zillow in an instant?

Here’s what you hate about the Zestimate. **You don't have the script or the skills to overcome clients who want to list their home at what the Zestimate says**. When this Zestimate is off, it gives you the opportunity to showcase your skills at valuing a home and showing how you can add value to a client.

**Zillow is your friend and you want to embrace that Zestimate.** It gives you an opportunity to improve your scripts and improve your lead conversion so that you can show potential clients what you have to offer.

If you have any questions about Zestimates, Zillow leads, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
