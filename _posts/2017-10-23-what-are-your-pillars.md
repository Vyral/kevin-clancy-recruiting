Lead generation is an important part of any real estate business. What are the pillars of lead generation in your business?

Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Clancy Real Estate, contact me at (518)861-7016 or Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com.

The real estate market in and around Albany is still hot, as you already know. A lot of you are probably doing some great numbers out there. **But what happens when the market slows down?**

Today I want to talk about lead generation and, more specifically, the pillars of lead generation. What are your pillars? Where do your leads come from? When the market changes, you’ll be stagnant if you don’t have strong pillars in place.

**A pillar could be anything from door knocking and cold calling to social media marketing and advertising.** The only thing that matters is that you are a master. Once you’ve mastered one pillar of lead generation, you can start to master another, like lead follow-up. That’s how a successful business is built.

If online marketing isn’t a pillar of lead generation for you already, it should be. You might think the concept of “buying leads” sounds like a waste of money, but you’re going to see returns. Our team has seen a 4 or 5x return on what we’ve spent already. That’s just for Zillow.

**Over 40% of our business comes from referrals.** This is where you want to end up because when a big portion of your business comes from word of mouth, you will see decreased costs and increased profitability.

If you have any questions for me, if you want to know how we generate 40% of our business through referrals, or if you just have a real estate question in general, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.
