Welcome back\!&nbsp;

Now that the spring market is well underway, you should be enjoying the limitless potential to sell homes. For our part, my team is selling homes left and right and we have more leads than we know what to do with.&nbsp;

If you can’t say the same, it begs the question: **Why are you struggling? &nbsp;**

It occurred to me earlier this week that there are two mindsets as it relates to this business and life: Either you’re miserable, risk-averse, and self-defeating when it comes to thinking big or you are thinking big and playing hard. In short, **it’s scarcity versus abundance.**

The bigger question, then, is do you come from scarcity or do you come from abundance? &nbsp;

If you’re in the former, figure out how you can move to the latter and live the life you so deserve. It’s all about casting aside your reservations and doubts and taking risks in your business.

For all of its rewards and benefits, many in real estate struggle for any number of reasons. In large part, though, we simply don’t think big enough. **Sharpen your focus and dedicate yourself to your own success.&nbsp;**

If you’re struggling with your business, don’t hesitate to give me a call at 518-461-9937 or email me at Kevin@ClancyRealEstate.com. I’d love to have a conversation with you, and there’s no obligation whatsoever. I look forward to speaking with you\!
