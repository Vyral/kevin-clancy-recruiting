<p style="text-align: center;"><em>People always ask me what sets me apart, and I’m excited to share my answer with you now.</em></p>

People always ask me, “What sets you apart?”

These people typically expect my answer to focus on just one factor, but, personally, there are two traits that I believe are equally significant in what makes me unique.&nbsp;

When I was named Times Union’s Best Real Estate Agent of the Year, I was literally working out of my bedroom doing 50 sales a year. Why, then, was I given this prestigious title?&nbsp;

It all comes down to the two traits I mentioned earlier, which I’ll list for you now:&nbsp;

**1. I have an airtight database marketing system.** Early on in my career, I learned to plug every single person I meet into my database right away. I also knew that simply entering names into a database wasn’t enough. Successful database marketing is all about putting meaningful systems in place for creating relationships and maintaining contact with each lead. Using video marketing, drip campaigns, and my tried-and-true CRM (Top Producer), I’ve built a proven system for success.&nbsp;

**2. I commit myself to constant learning.** As a real estate professional, I’m always looking for educational opportunities. Wise people know how little they know. It’s okay not to know everything, so long as you’re always striving to know more. I devour audiobooks while I run, travel to attend conferences, and am always looking to connect with my fellow agents. Knowledge is power, but it’s also wealth.&nbsp;

These two things have really been at the core of my business. They drive everything I do, and have been the foundation for my success from the very beginning.&nbsp;

Now that I’ve covered our main topic, I’d also like to share an exciting opportunity for you to earn $1,500. Here’s how:&nbsp;

My team is hiring. **If you refer someone you know to me and I hire them, I’ll pay you $1,500 when they make their first sale.** It’s as simple as that. If you have anyone in mind, don’t hesitate to reach out to me with their name and number.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
