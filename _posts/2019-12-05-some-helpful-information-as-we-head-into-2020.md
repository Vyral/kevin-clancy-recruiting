<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The new year will be here before you know it. Here are three things you should know heading into 2020.</em></p>

I’ve got a few quick, important things to discuss today.&nbsp;

**First, it’s time to start planning your business for 2020.** We’re almost at the end of 2019, so you need to be getting your business plan done, writing all of your goals down, and breaking down the tasks you need to complete consistently to reach those goals. Anmazing things happen when you write down your goals, so if you need any help with that, feel free to reach out.

Next, I wanted to talk about client appreciation events. We just had ours a few weeks ago and it was a blast. We gave out 200 apple pies, saw a lot of our clients, and even did a radio spot. **If you’re not doing an event like this, you should be.** It doesn’t matter what your budget is. You don’t have to go all out like we did, but maybe you could do an open bar for a few hours with some of your clients. You could also rent out a movie theatre for a screening and get the whole family involved.

**Finally, I just got back from the city and a fantastic meeting with Ryan Serhant from "Million Dollar Listing."** Despite his TV fame, he’s still dedicated to the craft of real estate and such a gifted salesperson. It was awesome to learn from him and I have some great marketing ideas to bring back to our business.

Great things are coming in 2020. If you want to make $100,000 a year on our team, there are currently two spots open for the right candidates. Just reach out to me to apply.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about your business or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
