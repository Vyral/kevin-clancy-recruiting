<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My holiday message to you this year: Stay strong and safe this season.</em></p>

It’s the holiday season, I’m wearing my festive suit, and I want to thank everyone who co-brokered a deal with us this year. We appreciate you very much.&nbsp;

I also want to remind you to stay strong. The holidays are here, the pandemic’s been going on for nine months now, and we may have another six months before the vaccines are distributed. I’ve seen videos in my listings where real estate agents aren’t wearing masks or gloves, and it’s disheartening. This health crisis is very dangerous; I’ve lost track of how many people I know who have contracted the coronavirus.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, small gatherings in homes are the top spreader of COVID-19 right now, so please be cognizant of that during your holiday celebrations. **Please stay strong and continue to be safe**. Keep your guard up, be professional, and have a safe holiday season with your loved ones.

We are very blessed as agents because so many of our small business friends are being decimated by the current situation. I appreciate each one of you, and I know I’m blessed to be in this profession. Keep all this in mind, and do what you can to support small businesses.

**If you’re struggling in your real estate career or want to make a change in 2021, call me anytime.** My team is growing because we have so much business we can’t keep up with the demand.&nbsp;

Have a joyful holiday season, merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, happy Chanukah, whatever you celebrate, have a fantastic one\! If you ever have any questions about real estate, please call or email me. I would love to be a resource for you.
