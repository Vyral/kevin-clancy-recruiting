<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether in life or business, surrounding yourself with people who are more successful than you is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself.</em></p>

The holidays can be a tough time for real estate, but don’t let that stop you from chasing success. There are a number of things you can do to stay successful no matter the state of the market, and one of the best ways is by **surrounding yourself with greatness.&nbsp;**

You’d be surprised how big an impact the people in your life have on your success. In many ways, you are the average of the people you spend your time with. If you find the average income of your five closest friends, for example, chances are that figure will reflect your own current income.&nbsp;

So who are you hanging out with? If you’re always the smartest person in the room, then you’re doing something wrong. **You should be surrounding yourself with people who are producing at a level you strive to someday reach—not at a level you’ve already surpassed.&nbsp;**

And the same concept applies in life, too. &nbsp;As you guys already know, I’m a runner. And as a runner, I often find that the people who motivate me most are the ones ahead of me in a race. It’s those kinds of people who push me to run faster. Even more interestingly, you never know when your own efforts will motivate someone else.&nbsp;

Take my most recent race, for example. I was keeping up a few paces behind this guy in front of me for most of the race, using his endurance as a way to keep myself going, only to find out by speaking to him later that he was using me as motivation too. He said that when he heard me coming up behind him, it made him want to run even faster. The point is this: **Being around greatness makes you better.**&nbsp;

So as the end of the year approaches, position yourself around people who you can learn and grow from. Find top producers and talk to them about what they’re doing to stay successful into 2019. Many of them will be happy to help you out.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
