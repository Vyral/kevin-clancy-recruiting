<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re concerned about not meeting your goals exactly as you have set them, I have some advice for you that will hopefully help change your perspective and continue to grow.</em></p>

Over the years in my business, I’ve learned a thing or two. So with my experience in mind, today I want to talk about goals and what’s really important about them.

If you didn’t know, I’ve been training really intensely to run a marathon that’s coming up in about four weeks. **My goal is to finish that marathon, but if I don’t, it’s not the end of the world for me.**

It’s not achieving the goal that’s important—it’s what the goal itself helps you to become.

I’m at my ideal weight, my heart rate is down to 59 BPM, I’ve increased my bench press limit by 40 lbs., and I’ve got more energy than ever. I feel great.

So it’s not about finishing the marathon, because none of those things will go away if I don’t. I’ve already won.

**That’s why I advise you to set crazy goals for yourself next year.** If you set a goal to do 10 pushups, you’ll eventually hit that mark and collapse on the floor, exhausted. But suppose you set your goal for 100 pushups—you probably won’t hit that mark right away, but it will push you to work harder and think about your process. Any sort of improvement is a win in my book.

I recently had an agent come into my office to talk about how they were concerned that they weren’t going to meet their yearly goals. My advice is to think about the process and what it would take to sell your goal number of homes. How would you do things differently? What would you do for prospecting?

**I guarantee that if you optimize your plan to reach your goal, you will absolutely end up selling more homes.** Even if it’s not the number you set for yourself, you’ll still improve and be a stronger agent for it.

If you need help with your goals, reach out to my team. I’d love to grab a coffee and speak with you about how you can become an even better agent.
