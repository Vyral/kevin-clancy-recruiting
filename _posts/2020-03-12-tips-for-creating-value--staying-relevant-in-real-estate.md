  The spring market is extremely hot right now. Mortgage rates are at historic
  lows, and if you’re working on the buy side, you’re probably putting in
  multiple offers for your clients and you might be struggling a bit. Today’s
  market is different than what it was just five or10 years ago; many online
  sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, or Trulia have real estate agents scared
  they’ll become obsolete.That doesn’t have to happen; the trick to staying
  alive in the industry is to bring your clients massive value. To learn how to
  do that, watch our latest video.

I was recently on a mastermind call with one of my longtime coaches, and our conversation had me thinking. The reality is that we in the industry might feel threatened by companies like Redfin, Opendoor, and all of these new venture capital firms entering the market.

However, this has created a huge opportunity for us if we create massive value for our clients. **Consumers no longer need us to put them in a search like they did five or 10 years ago.** Nowadays, they can go on sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, or Trulia and set up their own search. If all you’re doing for your clients is putting them in a search, you’re missing the boat.

Your job is to create massive value for your clients, to help keep them informed of things like the best school systems and the areas with the lowest tax rates—things that aren’t necessarily on the radar. Your job is to match them with your inventory and to guide them so they don’t overpay for a house that isn’t even a good fit for them. **If you’re just putting them in a search, they don’t need you**, and you’ll likely end up going out of business the same way that Expedia and Travelocity put travel agents out of business.

I don’t believe that companies like Zillow will put us out of business; Zillow can be a great partner. **But the key for you to remain relevant is to create value by over-communicating with your clients and letting them know how much you care about them**. Your clients want to know that you’ll guide them and work toward their best interests.

The most powerful thing you can ever say to a client (if it’s true) is that a particular house they’re looking at is a piece of garbage and that you can find them another one. No one wants your cheap sales talk; find your client the absolute best deal possible and handle every transaction like it was your own. **If you do that, you’ll generate massive value, you’ll be perceived as a professional, and you’ll increase your longevity in this industry.**
